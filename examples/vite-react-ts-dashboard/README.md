## Components

TailAdmin is a pre-designed starting point for building a web-based dashboard using React.js and Tailwind CSS. The
template includes:

- Sophisticated and accessible sidebar
- Data visualization components
- Prebuilt profile management and 404 page
- Tables and Charts(Line and Bar)
- Authentication forms and input elements
- Alerts, Dropdowns, Modals, Buttons and more
- Can't forget Dark Mode üï∂Ô∏è

All components are built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for easy customization.

## Walkthrough / Product Tour Integration

This example dashboard includes an integration of the **`just-a-walkthrough`** library (a lightweight, zero‚Äëdependency product tour system) to demonstrate how you can add onboarding flows to a real application UI.

### Why It‚Äôs Included

Interactive dashboards often benefit from guided introductions highlighting charts, profile areas, or configuration hotspots. The walkthrough library lets you:

- Spotlight elements (darkened backdrop + focus ring)
- Show a tooltip with step title/content & navigation
- Persist progress (localStorage) so users don‚Äôt repeat completed tours
- Chain multiple tours (e.g., dashboard first, then profile)
- Trigger tours on demand via a button or automatically per route (with the orchestrator helper)

### Where to Look in This Example

- `src/pages/Dashboard/Home.tsx` ‚Äì defines a multi‚Äëstep ‚ÄúCharts‚Äù tour aimed at KPIs & charts (`startChartsTour`).
- `src/pages/UserProfiles.tsx` ‚Äì defines a ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù tour explaining profile metadata & edit affordances.
- (Optional) You could add a dev panel or route orchestrator similarly to the main library README, but this example keeps it minimal.

### Basic Pattern Used

The example imports the React provider hook from the library source (in a real app you would `npm install just-a-walkthrough`). A button triggers the `start` function with an ordered array of steps:

```tsx
import { useWalkthrough } from 'just-a-walkthrough/react';

function ExampleButton() {
   const { start } = useWalkthrough();
   return (
      <button
         onClick={() => start([
            { selector: '#metric-customers', title: 'Customers', content: 'Key customer metric tile.' },
            { selector: '#chart-monthly-sales', title: 'Sales Trend', content: 'Recent monthly sales performance.' },
         ], { tourId: 'intro-dashboard', persistProgress: true })}
         className="px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-white rounded-md bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-500"
      >Start Dashboard Tour</button>
   );
}
```

### Adding the Provider

Wrap your app root once:

```tsx
import { WalkthroughProvider } from 'just-a-walkthrough/react';

export function AppRoot() {
   return (
      <WalkthroughProvider>
         <App />
      </WalkthroughProvider>
   );
}
```

### Step Authoring Tips

- Use stable selectors or data attributes (e.g., `data-tour="profile-heading"`).
- Set `stepWaitMs: 0` if the element is guaranteed present to avoid polling.
- Provide `tourId` + `persistProgress: true` so repeat visits skip already finished tours.

### Chaining (Optional)

You can combine tours sequentially using the `WalkthroughChain` API if you want to stage onboarding phases. In this example each tour is independent for clarity.

### Installing in Your Own Project

1. Install the package: `npm i just-a-walkthrough`
2. Wrap your root with the provider (optional but recommended for React convenience)
3. Add buttons / triggers that call the `start` function
4. (Optional) Register route-based tours and use the route orchestrator, or add the dev panel for local QA

Refer to the root repository README for advanced topics (debugging, dev panel, orchestrator, theming).
